#### How this was made

The analysis was done in **Apache Spark**. The inforgraphic was created in **Adobe InDesign** with the great help of [Hanh La](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hanh-la-06886b128/).

The dataset was obtained from MoMA's [github's repository](https://github.com/MuseumofModernArt/collection). 

See my [github repo](https://github.com/tri47/moma_collection_with_Spark/blob/master/README.md) for the Spark and Plotly code.
