Being the strategic and tactical planners for a company's offerings, a Product Manager interacts with many functional areas, and their relationship with the analytics team is often one of the most valuable and fruitful.

While the data analysts may not directly build the products, they certainly have a level of influence to what will be built, and how its success can be measured.

Having working in both product and analytics roles, I often find this collaborative effort to be a potentially very rewarding.

However, there were times where the collaboration could be better, and I would like to share three things that can help maximize the value of the product-analytics collaborative effort.

#### Tip #1: Be glad when they don't give you exactly what you asked, and give them the problems

How would you react if your manager suddenly gives you a list of new features and say "can you just go and build these in six months"?

Most Product Managers wouldn't enjoy being in that position.

We all like to solve problems, and thrive when being trusted with a problem and given freedom to explore the best way to solve it, especially as a Product Manager. 

Being told what to do runs counter to that instinct.

So it is strange that sometimes we will come to Data Analysts with our mind already made up about what metrics and charts we want to see.

Instead, we should explain our goals and what we believe success looks like, and let the analysts come up with their recommendations.

you're more likely to receive a better outcome than dictating how data should be presented.

You don't want your analysts to give you exactly what you asked for without asking questions, or pondering on the best statistical method and data to use. In fact, that would be a sign of a decaying working partnership where the analysts have stopped trying to provide the most useful intels to you. They may be giving you exactly what you asked for so you will go away.

Just like how Product Managers are the domain expert of their product, the Data Analysts provides their data product in the form of dataset, dashboards, visualizations or detailed analyses. A seasoned analyst know where to look, what question to ask, and what techniques to use to best help inform their stakeholders.

So instead of saying: 

- Can you give me the monthly number of active customers? (what do we mean by "active" and "customers" anyway?).

Say:

- We want to estimate the user pool we can expose to this new campaign to drive conversion - how do you think we should go about it?


#### Tip #2: Involve them early

Analysts often come across useful data and trends that can really add value to your planning. And after a new release, you almost always want to see how it performs.

So create a card to touch base with your analytics team at some point during your developemnt process, this helps avoid last minute request for tracking, reporting, or experimentation setup.

Analytics can be missed when you have to focus more on the development itself. So putting in a reminder, or making analytics involvement a standard part of your process will ensure that your are covered.

So instead of saying:

- We just launched this thing, can I get a report on how many people looked at it?

Say:

- We are planning on rolling out this thing, can you come to our planning session to provide input into what we can assess its impact down the line?


#### Tip #3: Avoid delaying decision, and let's stop splitting customers by more "interesting" attributes

Analytics can hinder decision makers if it is used to as a scapegoat for why decision delay is necessary.

The manifestation of this is the business stakeholders will postpone making any call before they see "more" data.

While it is true you should some numbers before making any big decision, that is not a reason to not set a decision threshold beforehand, e.g. "if the improvement is less than x%, I will roll it back".

The value of analytics can be seen as the level of surprise you have when you see the data, i.e. how wrong your earlier assumption was. By pre-define a decision threshold and  the actions that you will take based on the threshold, you avoid being biased by the data when you see it.

Consider these two statements "it will be ***"interesting"*** to see data on ...", and "if the data on this is x%, that means we can do y". 

The first sentence is bourne out of curiosity, and has no commitment to action. The second sense is the opposite. Analytical resource is limited, you want it to be spent on more on the later.

So instead of saying: 

- Let's look at the churn rate before we decide if that's something we should focus on next quarter.

Say: 
- What is a safe level of churn that we can tolerate and leave alone for a quarter?

#### Final Remarks

These tips by no means are easy habit to develop, and you may still have other roadblocks that prevent you from following them in your interaction with your analytics team.

However, by making even some minor adjustment in these direction, you can empower your analytics people to come up with brilliant ideas on how to solve problems and discovery growth possibilities within the sea of information that they live in.
