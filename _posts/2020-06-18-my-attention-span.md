summary: Our attention span is decaying. We are addicted to short tweets, videos and stimulus. The only question is ... wait, where was I?

Human attention span was reduced from [12 seconds to 8 seconds between 2000-2015](https://venturebeat.com/2016/12/04/our-8-second-attention-span-and-the-future-of-news-media/).

It is also difficult for us to focus for longer than 20-30 minutes, which is why a good public speaker should be less than 20 minutes and lectures are generally less than 45 minutes.

I try to measure my attention span by tracking how long I can focus on a task before my mind starts to wander. 

I stop the clock as soon as I get distracted, even if for only 10 seconds and I resume work immediately after.

#### How this was made
I recorded my work sessions with a timesheet software [Clockify](https://clockify.me/). The viz is done in Tableau.

It does not cover all my work sessions, but is a good representation of my pattern.

#### Further reading
[The shallows](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9778945-the-shallows) is a good book on how the internet affects our brain.

[This Guardian article](https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/oct/08/is-the-internet-killing-our-brains) offers a more balanced view.
