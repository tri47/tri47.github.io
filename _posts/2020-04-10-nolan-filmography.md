Christopher Nolan is one of the most celebrated directors with a cult following after his breakthrough with Memento. His latest film (Tenet) is coming out this year. 

While we are waiting, let's have a look at his previous feature films.
<br/>

The Dark Knight Rises was the most highly grossed film, with a comparable huge budget, despite sitting squarely in the middle of the pack in popularity (IMDB Score). The Prestige had a modest budget of $40 million compared to its brothers like Interstellar, Inception, but it still faired very well in IMDB rating. 

Dunkirk is no doubt the most polarising film among Nolan's fans, only considered better than Nolan's widely deemed worst films (Insomnia and Following). 

Everyone's favourite is, unsurprisingly, The Dark Knight with the stellar performance by Heath Ledger.

Looking closer at the profit, Nolan only starts to make blockbusters consistently after the first Batman. I found The Prestige to be his most polished film. It is a shame that it did not receive more commercial success.

Nolan's films have received 10 Academy Awards and more than thrice as many nominations. With the exception of Heath Ledger as the Joker receiving an award for performance, most of the nominations and awards are in editting, writing, music and cinematography (hover on the chart to see categories).

This brings us to the important collaborations in Nolan's films. Nolan works with only a handful of composers, cinematographers and editors, and it pays off. Wally Pfister, for instance, has worked on 7 out of 10 of Nolan's films, received 4 nominations and won 1 oscar for cinematography.

I love the music from Interstellar, and cannot wait for Hans Zimmer to finally receive an Academy Award for his wonderful work.

Nolan's films are typically very long (in a good way), here, we can see exactly how long. To get the most of Nolanian goodness, look no further than Interstellar with more than two and a half hours.  
The Dark Knight Rises might have received a more positive response had it been a tad shorter.

Many actors and actresses reappear constantly in Nolan's films. And the winner (\*drum roll\*) is Michael Caine! He was Alfred in the Batmans, John Cutter in the Prestige, Stephen Miles in Inception, and Professor Brand in Interstellar.

There are some other interesting facts. There are quite a few "Nolans" who reappears in several films. I also missed how often Tom Hardy (Mad Max) appears in Nolan's films. And if you're like me and be like "who the hell is Russ Fega", look him up.

I am sure many will be hoping for the big stars like Morgan Freeman, Leonardo DiCaprio, Anne Hathaway, Liam Neeson to make more appearances. 

### Outro
This is an exciting time for Nolan fans, as his latest film is due soon, and Memento has received a green light for a remake.

This was an interesting journey to look at Nolan's cinematic achievements of the last 20 years. Hopefully I will be able to do the same for my other two favorite directors: David Fincher and Wes Anderson.
