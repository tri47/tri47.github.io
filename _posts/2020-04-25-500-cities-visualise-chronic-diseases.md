This is a team project that I did as part of my master at Georgia Tech.

We analysed the data from CDC's [500 Cities project](https://www.cdc.gov/500cities/index.htm) which provides census-track level estimates of diseases' prevalence, risk factors such as drinking, lack of excercise etc. and preventions. The project involves processing and analysis those relationships at different geometric levels (city, state, country-wide).

## The analysis
We used Scikit-learn to do the majority of the analysis. We ended up with 5 most relevant factors for each disease, which we then visualise it Tableau.

## The visualisation
The visualisation can be viewed [here](https://public.tableau.com/profile/tri1422#!/vizhome/VizExamples2019_1_2_15543742823730/Story). For tbe best result, view this on a large screen.
