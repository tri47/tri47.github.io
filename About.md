Hi, this is <span class="red-text" style="font-size: 16px"> **Tri**</span> - 'tree'. I am a Data Geek based in <span class="red-text">**Melbourne, Australia**</span>. 

My mission is to help people and organisations navigate our connected, data-rich world to find <span class="red-text">**facts that matter**</span> to them. 

Find me on [**LinkedIn**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tri-q-nguyen), and [**GitHub**](https://github.com/tri47).

I have worked as a <span class="green-text">**Data Analyst**</span>, and an <span class="green-text">**Engineer**</span> at Telstra, Spectrum Engineering and the CSIRO. 

I did my undergraduate at the [**ANU**](https://www.anu.edu.au/). I am also studying part-time for a Master in Data Science at [**Georgia Tech**](https://www.gatech.edu/). Go Jackets!

While not at my desk, I enjoy bouldering, Judo, hiking and board games.
