Hi, my name is <span class="red-text" style="font-size: 20px"> **Tri**</span> ('tree'). I am a data enthusiast based in <span class="red-text">**Melbourne, Australia**</span>. My career interests are in data analysis, data visualisation, NLP and digital products.

I have worked as a <span class="red-text">**Data Analyst**</span>, a <span class="red-text">**Business Analyst**</span>, and an <span class="red-text">**Engineer**</span> at Telstra, Service Stream, Spectrum Engineering and CSIRO. My bachelor degree was in Engineering from [**ANU**](https://www.anu.edu.au/).

I am also studying part-time for a Master in Data Science at [**Georgia Tech**](https://www.gatech.edu/). Go Jackets!

While not at my desk, I enjoy bouldering, Judo, hiking and strategy board games.
