Hi, this is <span class="red-text" style="font-size: 16px"> **Tri**</span> - 'tree'. I am a Data Geek based in <span class="red-text">**Melbourne, Australia**</span>. 

My mission is to help people and organisations find <span class="red-text">**facts that matter**</span> to them in our connected and complex world.

Find me on [**LinkedIn**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tri-q-nguyen), and [**GitHub**](https://github.com/tri47).

Please feel free to reach out for <span class="red-text">**a chat**</span> about anything over a coffee. Even about the coffee itself!

I am working as a <span class="red-text">**Product Data Analyst**</span> at Openpay. My previous gigs were at Telstra, Spectrum Engineering and the CSIRO. 

I am also studying part-time for a Master in Data Science at [**Georgia Tech**](https://www.gatech.edu/). 

While not at my desk, I enjoy bouldering, Judo, hiking and board games.
