Hi, this is <span class="red-text" style="font-size: 16px"> **Tri**</span> ('tree'). I am a DATA GEEK based in <span class="red-text">**Melbourne, Australia**</span>. My mission is to make it a bit easier for people and organisations to find <span class="red-text">**facts that matter**</span> to them in a perflexing, connected world. <span class="red-text">**Scatta**</span> is a repository for my writings on data visualisation, NLP and digital products.

Find me on [**LinkedIn**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tri-q-nguyen), and [**GitHub**](https://github.com/tri47).

I have worked as a <span class="red-text">**Data Analyst**</span>, a <span class="red-text">**Business Analyst**</span>, and an <span class="red-text">**Engineer**</span> at Telstra, Service Stream, Spectrum Engineering and CSIRO. My bachelor degree was in Engineering from [**ANU**](https://www.anu.edu.au/).

I also studies part-time for a Master in Data Science at [**Georgia Tech**](https://www.gatech.edu/). Go Jackets!

While not at my desk, I enjoy bouldering, Judo, hiking and strategy board games.
